# BlackJack and other casino games hopefully
The final goal of this project is to create a small little casino app, where you can play multiple games such as blackjack, slots and baccarat.

A few notes about this project:
1) When i first started this, the main goal was just to create a small blackjack simulator using the python terminal. I had no real experience making such a programme or even a GitHub repository for it.
 As a result the code is written very poorly in alot of places and the first commit is basically just a giant copy/paste of my original code without any real structure.

2) the poetry is absolutely useless and I havent really done anything with it, so if youre interested in collaborating please let me know, i could use the help.
3) The commit messages are also useless because i was just using github for backups.
4) If anyone ever reads this please feel free to check out the code and tell me if you see anything that needs to be improved or could have been done better.
5) ALSO if you know the mathematics behind slot machines tell me, i cant find it anywhere.

The blackjack simulator is like 80% done so try it out!

The slot machine also works but dont expect too much.

Baccarat is a problem for another day!
